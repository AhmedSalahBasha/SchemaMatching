Data Integration - Schema Matching &amp; Mapping

Tasks
2.1. Label-Based Schema Matching 

Here, we want to find the correspondences between the columns from the two datasets
with the help of only schema headers.
1. Provide an algorithm. Specify the input, output, similarity function, and time
complexity.
2. Implement the algorithm and report the results. Is there any parameter that affects
the results?
3. What is the upsides and downsides of this method? When does it work and when
not?

2.2. Instance-Based Schema Matching

Here, we want to find the correspondences between the columns from the two datasets
with the help of only data values.
1. Provide an algorithm. Specify the input, output, similarity function, and time
complexity.
2. Implement the algorithm and report the results. Is there any parameter that affects
the results?
3. What is the upsides and downsides of this method? When does it work and when
